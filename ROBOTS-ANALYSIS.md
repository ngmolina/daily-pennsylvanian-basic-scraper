# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on March 2, 2025

```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file contains two main directives:

1. For all user agents (`User-agent: *`):
   - `Crawl-delay: 10`: This instructs web crawlers to wait at least 10 seconds between consecutive requests to the website. This helps prevent overloading the server with too many requests in a short period.
   - `Allow: /`: This explicitly permits crawling of all parts of the website. While this permission is typically the default behavior when no `Disallow` directives are specified, this explicit allowance confirms that the site welcomes crawlers to access all its content.

2. For a specific crawler called SemrushBot (`User-agent: SemrushBot`):
   - `Disallow: /`: This specifically prohibits the SemrushBot crawler from accessing any part of the website. SemrushBot is a crawler used by SEO tool Semrush, and the site owners have chosen to block it.

For our scraping project, this `robots.txt` file indicates that:
- Our scraper is allowed to access the front page of the Daily Pennsylvanian website
- We should respect the crawl delay of 10 seconds between requests
- Since we're only planning to scrape once per day, we're well within the crawl delay guidelines
- We're not using SemrushBot, so the specific disallow directive doesn't apply to our scraper

In conclusion, our planned scraping activity (accessing the front page once per day to extract headlines) is compliant with the website's `robots.txt` directives, making our scraping activity both technically permissible and ethically sound according to web scraping best practices.
